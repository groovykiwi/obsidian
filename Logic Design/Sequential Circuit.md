Combinational circuit rely exclusively on the inputs / fucntion of inputs 
Sequential circuits a function of inputs and internal memory

Synchronous is controlled by a clock
Clock signal is an input to the memory elements

present state: output value of memory (stored)
next state: input value to memory (to be stored)
